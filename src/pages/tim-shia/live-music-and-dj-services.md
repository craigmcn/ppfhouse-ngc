PPF Music's acclaimed *Love Orchestra* features a diverse roster of in-demand and Juno award nominated/winning musicians available in a variety of configurations from guitar and piano jazz/blues trios, to large pop and dance bands. Led by Tim Shia, the Love Orchestra can be customized to any mood, event or venue, making it the ideal group for everything from important corporate functions to bar mitzvahs to weddings and private parties.

In addition, PPF's in-house audiophile, Leo Shia, is one of Toronto's most diverse and effective DJ's, providing the right music and mood - playing Classic Rock to Hip Hop for everyone from Nike and LeBron James to Aloe Black.

*"Tim Shia's Love Orchestra in session, the busy band with a sense of commitment surges with layered rhythms, slithery horn and bass line and nifty chorus swaps..." Geoff Chapman, Toronto Star*
