Tim makes music. Sometimes it is good and acclaimed, and gets featured on *allaboutjazz, Canadian Musician, tojazz.com, CBC, Toronto Star, NOW Magazine and TEDx;* used in films for the *Governor General Awards, the NFB, CBC, Teletoon and Disney;* and even reaches #1 on college radio charts.

Other times it is bad. We don't talk about those times.

Aside from providing music/sound design for film and television with **PPF**, or playing drums for international artists, Grammy and Juno winners (and losers), like *Michael Herring, Kevin Barrett, Amanda Martinez, Ron Davis, Elizabeth Shepherd, Chris Hunt, Don Scott, Emma Cook, Andrew Rasmussen, Dan Fortin, Allison Au, Mark Godfrey, Bret Higgins, Daniela Nardi, Don Scott, Laila Biali, Julie Michels, LEO37, Shan VDP, Milosh, Kevin Clarke, Rhonda Stakich, Carol Welsman, James Roberston, Fred Spek, Beverly Taft, Scott Marshall, Quique Escamilla,*  and *Rich Underhill*, Tim also leads a band called [**the Worst Pop Band Ever** ](https://www.wpbe.ppfhouse.com/) with Chris Gale, Adrean Farrugia, Dafydd Hughes, Drew Birston and LEO37; co-leads **[Shiverbeck](https://shiverbeck.bandcamp.com/releases)** with Nick Zubeck and Mark Laver; and runs **[Jazz for Juniors](https://ppfhouse.com/music/jazz4jrs/)**, a program that teaches younger folk about jazz.

Tim is a [*Dream Cymbal*](https://www.dreamcymbals.com/) and *[Headhunter Sticks](https://www.headhuntersdrumsticks.net/)* endorsee. He recently produced and hosted an 8 part educational series called "Jazz is What?!" for Jazz Fm 91.1 and is an occasional host for "the Worst Jazz Program Ever" on Istolethesoul FM.

He lives in Toronto with his lovely wife and three feral children.

Tim can be followed on [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/timshia). But he doesn't actually know what he's doing on it.
