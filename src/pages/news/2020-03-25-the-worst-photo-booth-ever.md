With the cancellation of our gigs for the next few months, we took some time to record a radio play based on our Worst Photo Booth Ever concept and posted it on <https://wpbe.bandcamp.com/> in hopes of raising funds for Sophia Perlman's wonderful Hornepayne Community Project which tries to connect artists and resources from Southern Ontario to under serviced communities in Northern Ontario. Be safe everyone!
