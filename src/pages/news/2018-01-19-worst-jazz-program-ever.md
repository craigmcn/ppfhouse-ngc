What?!! someone gave us our own radio show? yup live on Feb.2nd(technically the 3rd), from 12-1 am on [Istolethesoulfm](https://www.facebook.com/events/582110988796802/?notif_t=event_calendar_create&notif_id=1516326234109609) Radio. I don't know how it works, but I'll be doing what I always do...speaking nonsense and playing some of my favourite tunes. Can we do a coffee enema on air?
