Blue. Bunny. Stampede.

Isn't that enough?

Our good friend [**ProF**](http://prof.bandcamp.com) over @ **5&amp;1/4 Records** has just released a brand new single with the labels top dog, [**Vangel**](http://vangel.bandcamp.com) that most definitely lives up to both its title as well as the reps these 2 have skillfully carved out for themselves over the years.

I can say without hesitation that this is my **FAVORITE** ProF track to date, and well, I'm not the only one...

 *We're already fans of ProF's laid back productions here at Chrome Kids but think this has to be our favourite so far. It's sundown at the beach meets sunrise on Mars, a beautiful liquid crunching digital Hip-hop funk fest.* - **CHROME KIDS**

Click **ProF**'s crazy Blue face for the DL.
