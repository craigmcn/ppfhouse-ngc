Friends, Romans, Countrymen, so on and so forth...  
  
Howie just remembered that *[FLUTTER](HTTP://www.ppfhouse.com/flutter)* is making its world television premiere **Friday night (November 9)** at **7:30EST** on **BRAVO!**. It will be part of a special all animation episode of [BravoFact! Presents](http://www.bravo.ca/television/tvshows/show.aspx?showID=Bravo!FACT%20Presents). Tune in!  
  
*FLUTTER* will also be playing on the big screen on **Thursday November 15** at **Innis Town Hall** (2 Sussex Ave) at **6pm** as part of the very awesome [**Toronto Reel Asian International Film Festival** ](http://www.reelasian.com). Howie will be on hand to elbow smash anybody foolish enough to ask questions.  
  
Following the screening, **Howie, [John Poon](http://WWW.myspace.com/doomedtunes), [Sunclef (Matt Hedlin)](http://WWW.myspace.com/sunclef)** and **[Abyss](http://WWW.myspace.com/theabyss)** will be at **SPIN Gallery** on Queen West, fabricating music as accompaniment for the ultra-incroyable **[PIKA PIKA LIGHTNING DOODLE PROJECT](http://www.reelasian.com/program_s.php?program_id=124)** from Japan. Bring anything you have that makes light (mobiles, ipods, uranium) and you can be a part of the movie making experience! This event is also being brought to you by the good folks at Reel Asian. Doors open at at 8:30. Show starts at 9. Love is a battlefield.
