Howdy folks,   
   
 It's November and the **[Toronto Reel Asian International Film Festival](http://www.reelasian.com/)** is once again up 'n' at'em. Always a great festival with loads of moving pictures for every palette, this year's festival has T-shirts designed by Howie (Shia... of PPF House) which you can buy at **Innis Town Hall** (2 Sussex Ave), as well as some of the post-screening parties (we think). Howie also did the delegate tote bags - but those aren't available to the public. For more info, contact the festival directly [here](http://www.reelasian.com/) or better yet, just check out the festival!

 **Worst Pop Band Ever is back in the studio!**   
 The WPBE is heading back into the studio at the end of the month to record their sophomore album! That noise you're hearing now is the sound of your ears clapping.   
   
 If that statement makes sense to you, you should see a doctor.
