Looking for something weird to watch/listen to during lockdown? Then may we humbly suggest [the Worst Photo Booth Ever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAL8INUERWE). With the support of the In The Soil Festival, The Canada Council for the Arts, as well as the Toronto and Ontario Arts councils at various stages, we put together a little video that is sure to cause some head scratching. It does feature some new music though and was done completely unrehearsed and socially distanced during that special year known as 2020. It's also exclusively available as a [radioplay](https://wpbe.bandcamp.com/) on our Bandcamp page, so you can download it or stream it like a podcast. You're welcome.
