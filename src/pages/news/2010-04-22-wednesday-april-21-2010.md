Some new love courtesy of[ **fromthefeetup.ca**](http://www.momentumshop.ca/blog/uncategorized/leo37-icarus/)

*'What a time for this to come through, the homie LEO37 just released a short EP (2 songs) and it’s that feel good music needed for these heated days. Bordering the melodic obscurity of Japanese Jazz-Hop, LEO37’s *Icarus* is an infusion of just that: Jazz and Hip-Hop. After a few repeated listens, I’ve decided that *Icarus* is perfect for the upcoming months — relax and bump it...Icarus provides you with 2 songs for free and with dope artwork like that, there shouldn’t be any hesitation.'*

Shout out to Asif and the crew. If you're ever in Saskatoon and need some hot new kicks, check that blog and follow the address.
