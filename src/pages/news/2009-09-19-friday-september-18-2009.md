**IT. HAS. ARRIVED!**

After 3 years of solid gigging, writing and fine tuning the offensive qualities of his insults, **PPF House** co-founder and vagrant, **Tim Shia**, along with **the Worst Pop Band Ever** have returned with their Sophomore effort, [**'dost thou believeth in science?'**](http://wpbe.bandcamp.com)

[![](http://bandcamp.com/files/24/77/2477539651-1.jpg)](http://wpbe.bandcamp.com)

Featuring 10 brand new tracks as well as guest appearances from long time collaborators, **Rob Ritchie, Rhonda Stakich** and **Elizabeth Shepherd**, this record is Ric Flair *'WOO'ing',* Scott Hall *'Razor's Edge'ing'*, Iron Sheik *' Camel Clutch'ingly'* awesome (can you tell I grew up on wrestling?).

Don't believeth me? As a bonus to go along with **'The Worst Tour Ever'** *(Starting Monday!!)* we're giving you the opportunity to **Preview AND Purchase the whole album TODAY!**
