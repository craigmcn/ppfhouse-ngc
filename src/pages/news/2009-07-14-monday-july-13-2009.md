[**PPFaithful,**](http://leo37.bandcamp.com)

After only **12 HOURS** of being live, the support for [**LEO37 + Sunclef's**](http://leo37.bandcamp.com) new tune **HOMEBODY STATUS** has been tremendous and has almost doubled the amount of download's we received the first day for the **PPF Attic.**

Thank you so much for your support.

If you're really enjoying it, please let all your friends know and tell them to [**DOWNLOAD IT** ](http://leo37.bandcamp.com)as the song will cease to be free starting midnight tomorrow evening!

We leave on tour TOMORROW and can't wait to rock with you in your respective cities. Please, check the calendar on the right and the poster below so you can mark it off in your datebook NOW!
