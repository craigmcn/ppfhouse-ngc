As promised, we're getting a slew of flicks this year. Our multimedia game will be fully on the level and we promise your eyes and ears a barrage of goodies for '09.

Hell, just browse the site if you don't believe us.

On top of that....shows, shows and more shows. [MAG](http://www.myspace.com/magnolius) are already setting up for what promises to be a demolition of hearts in March as well as the re-introduction of [LEO37](http://www.myspace.com/leo37) to the Canadian scene.

But as promised, our goodie train continues with [Joe Russo'](http://gogo7188.ca/jrphoto)s flicks from **HHHT6** in Taichung. Click below for more.
