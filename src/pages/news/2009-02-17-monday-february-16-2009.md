**IT'S OVER!**

My [war against the machine](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXVuy0h29c) *(my hard drive)* is finished. After two weeks of constant battles, worry and rage, I, [**LEO37**](http://www.myspace.com/leo37), am finally.....[relaxed](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERQzl4xDpXk).

And whilst in this relaxed state, I'm happy to bring you some news:

As some of you may or may not know, [*half* ](http://www.myspace.com/magnolius)of the [**PPF House**](http://www.facebook.com/pages/PPF-House/32210491219?ref=ts) has this weird obsession with new projects in that we don't provide anyone *(or at least do our very best to)* any information, clues or previews as to what we're working on.

I call it <span style="font-weight: bold;">[Wedding Night](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlCWo1qdTdE) Syndrome</span>**.**

I've named it such because, while the [*other half*](http://www.myspace.com/thabyss) are cool with dropping snippets here and there, teasing their fans and supporters (This is called **[Winnie Cooper](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DvgB1PTysE) Syndrome**), this other [*half* ](http://www.myspace.com/leo37)of the family prefer the whole reveal in one fell swoop.

Well, this year, you're getting *Wedding Nights* *&amp; Winnie Coopers*:
