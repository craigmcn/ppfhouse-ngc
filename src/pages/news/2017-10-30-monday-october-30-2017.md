4 chances to see the Worst Pop Band Ever in Ottawa this weekend. Aside from playing at the Brookstreet Hotel Friday and Saturday night (8pm), during the day we're doing a Masterclass at Carleton University at 12pm on Friday the 3rd and then an in store performance at the super hip Record Centre at 12pm on Saturday. Also Chris might jog around the Market with his shirt off posing for selfies. oh and happy halloween![](https://scontent.fyto1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/22885948_10155839869266823_491066250382439664_n.png?oh=3e73dd1013427ef2c0df4ccd312447f4&oe=5AA6363C)
