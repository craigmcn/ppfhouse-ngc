My goodness me oh my.

First off, what the hell is in the water in London?! The audience we had the **privilege** *(and please let me emphasize* *PRIVILEGE*) of rocking with last night was unreal and truly one of those groups of people that remind us just why the hell we do this.

On top of that, [**Keys &amp; Krates**](http://www.keysnkrates.com/) and [**Smash Brovaz**](http://www.myspace.com/smashbrovaz) both massacred their sets and well....dang homie....the stars were aligned last night.

Thank you London and Fanshawe College for providing such a gorgeous scenario and we hope to be back *very* soon!

Secondly. Next Saturday. October 9th. Click the pic above and let's get it crackin.

We in this people. Don't ever forget.

Be well world.
