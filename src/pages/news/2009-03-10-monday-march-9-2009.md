Also, this week [Tim ](http://www.myspace.com/wpbe)will be with the ever lovely [Rhonda Stakich](http://www.myspace.com/rhondastakich) in **Edmonton,** **Friday** for a special **CBC Radio presentation**. Meanwhile [**MAGNOLIUS**](http://www.myspace.com/magnolius) will rightfully have a slot this **Saturday** at **Circa** for the storied **Canadian Music Week**<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>here in Toronto *(as well as the continuation of* **MAG month***, see calendar for details* ---&gt;*).*

Lookout in the next few days for [**Shan** and **Derek**](http://www.ppfhouse.com/music/magnolius) to give you some insight as to what the hell's wrong with'em.

'Til then....be well world.
