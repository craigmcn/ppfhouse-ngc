**TOP RANKIN!**

I'm at an absolute loss for words. Saturday may've been one of the most amazing evenings I've ever been witness to, and for that I thank the amazing support and love that everyone showed the House. It's official, **the Abyss** has arrived!

For those who were there, you know what I'm talking about, to those who weren't, visual evidence is coming soon. Until then, **[TOP RANKIN](http://theabyss.bandcamp.com) is OUT** and you need it in your life.

Congratulations **'Byss and Dez**!

From everyone at **the House** to you: **Love**.
