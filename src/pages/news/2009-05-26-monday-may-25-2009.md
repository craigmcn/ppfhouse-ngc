Let's talk.

Since my re-entry into Canada, things've been busy.\*\*

*\*\*Yeah I know I talk a lot about being 'busy' and I'm trying to introduce new adjectives into my carousel of 'crutch' words but just be glad it's changed from my previous state of always being 'tired'. That's just too much Eeyore nonsense....I effin hate Eeyore.*

Currently I'm finalizing all the dates for our **Cross-Canada tour** this summer *(all dates will be posted first week of June)* as well as finishing the mixing/mastering to **'Applause'** with [**Sunclef**](http://www.myspace.com/sunclef) which shall finally see the light of day this **July!**

On top of that, like our counterparts [**Howie Shia**](http://www.ppfhouse.com/video), [**MAGNOLIUS**](http://magnolius.bandcamp.com) and [**The Abyss**](http://www.myspace.com/thabyss), **Sunclef** and **I** will be headed towards the visual age and we'll be givin you [Eye Jammies](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILvkEHQPHHg) in no time.

However, as all this is **'Coming Up'**, I'm sure you're curious as to what you could do right at this moment to satisfy your **PPFamine**...well lemme break it down.

Just in case you're not familiar with the last button...the BC stands for **Bandcamp!** And although the name is not ideal, the setup IS. Go there now to preview the **ENTIRE** PPF Catalogue and purchase individual songs or full albums at discount prices.

That's me for now, but there's plenty more comin.

Be well world.

Triple.
