What better way to've spent 4/20 than in the capital of the Cannabis Cup, the Red Light Haven, the Coffee Shop Paradise, the land of a million bikes....I'm talkin.......**Amsterdam.**

Well the [**MAG**](http://www.myspace.com/magnolius) boys are currently there and just uploaded some visual goodies to let you know just how European life is treating them. Head over to the newly created, [**PPF HOUSE YOUTUBE CHANNEL**](http://www.youtube.com/ppfhouse) to check'em out. All of **MAG**'s vids are located in the **'Favorites'** section.

Incidentally, on a sidenote, thanks to Wikipedia, I finally found out where 4:20 comes from:

*'The origin of the term stems from a story about a group of teenagers at San Rafael High School in San Rafael, California, United States in 1971. The teens would meet after school at 4:20 p.m. to smoke marijuana at the Louis Pasteur statue. The exact time was chosen because that was the time that afternoon detention was dismissed.*

Nothin' to do with Marley....friggin Telephone facts.

Aaaaaanyway...as promised, the [**WPBE**](http://www.myspace.com/wpbe) continue their April stand at [**the Rex**](http://www.therex.ca) starting @ 9:30pm. The crowds've been growing and the tunes heavier, so get their a touch early to secure seating.

And finally, [**LEO37**](http://www.myspace.com/leo37) was recently interviewed by [**Waakao.com**](http://www.waakao.com) about where he's been, where he's goin and how he plans to get there. Click the pic for the interview.
