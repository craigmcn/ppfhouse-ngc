As a result we perform on July 15 at Harbourfront Mainstage from 7-7:30pm before a distinguished jury and anyone else who wants to watch. People apparently can even vote for us at <http://www.harbourfrontcentre.com/soundclash>

Oh and Michael Herring, Eric St. Laurent and Sophia Perlman will all be joining us.

Now wouldn't it be funny if the improvising jazz band with the funny name beat out all the other hip urban finalists.
