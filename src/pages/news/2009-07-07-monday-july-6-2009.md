If the past 2 weeks have been any indication of the way OH NINE will go, I may just have to proceed and start my own line of **PPF House Action Figures**. Not cause we'll be making some type of mega superstar money, but just cause I've always wanted my own action figure. And in case you were wondering, that first sentence had NOTHING to do with the second.

Anyway, here's how Ottawa went...

**WPBE @ The National Arts Centre (Ottawa Jazz Fest)**

If you don't know already, these guys are [World Champions.](http://www.myspace.com/wpbe)

*World Champions of what?*  Well, **Drew**'s pretty much the grandmaster of Pun *(the Art of...)*. **Chris** is quite the success when *'borrowing'* and '*testing'* other people's beverages. **Tim** has proven himself a master of the lookout. **Adrean** has a world champions' fear of onions and well, **LEO37** is good at helping Chris *'test'* the beverages he borrowed in the first place.

Despite these amazing god given talents, the boys managed to pull themselves away from their lane and play a great show to a near packed **NAC.** Combining a set of genre pushing songs with Le Heavy *(it's Fraunche for the Greatest World Champion Musicianers in the Cosmos)*, and phenomenal self depricating mic work courtesy Tim, they were able to mix the generally dramatic and high-brow nature of the venue with the experience of a night in a ballpit at McDonald's Playland.

Good times.

The crowd response was great, we signed some t-shirts, pushed some units and all in all everyone had an incredible time. Incidentally, we'd really like to thank the **Ottawa Jazz Fest** for their hospitality and we definitely are looking forward to coming back in the future.

With the sophomore LP on the way, ['**Dost Thou Believeth in Science'** ](http://wpbe.bandcamp.com)- *officially seeing the light of day this* *November -* these guys have plenty of news coming in the next 2 months, so stay tuned!

In the meantime, check back tomorrow for some goodies and info on **MAG, LEO37 + Sunclef** and **Tanika Charles**' trip to **Motown**. Goodness galore.

I'm falling asleep on my keyboard.

It's all for youajfdka; ldd/ ma;klm, ggggggggg
