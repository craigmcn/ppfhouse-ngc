**Home.**

After an incredible 3 days of screechings, George St.people watching, Signal Hill climbing and chowder *(lots and lots of chowder - I'm lookin at you Birston)*, the **WPBE** have returned home from St. John's a little chubbier, a little rummier and anxious to go back for seconds.

A big thanks to everyone at the **Wreckhouse Jazz Festival** for being so welcoming and accomodating and we look forward to being back soon.

In the meantime, some brand new words from **The Wholenote**. 10 months in and ***Dost Thou*** stays gettin love...

*"Itâ€™s all easy on the ear, expertly and effortlessly delivered with elaborate solos and surprising heat."*

Be well world.
