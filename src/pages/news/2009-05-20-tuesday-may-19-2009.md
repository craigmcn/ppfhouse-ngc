What can I say, the **EXPO** was dope!

Despite the cold weather, the Sunday night and everything else goin on in your lives....we got the place busy and bumpin!

Abstract breakbeats, hardcore 80's, heavy hip-hop, soulful house and a bunch of loudmouthed tyrants running around *ON* the bar. All in all....goodness.

Shout outs to: [**Vangel**](http://www.myspace.com/vangelmusic), [**ProF**](http://www.myspace.com/professorfingers), **Richniques**, [**Tanika**](http://www.myspace.com/tanikacharles), [**Shafey**](http://www.shafeyspalace.com), [**the entire House**](http://ppfhouse.bandcamp.com) and everyone who helped make the evening a success. Please believe that this is just the beginning and there are plenty more events on the way. PLENTY! *(more on that next week)*.

In the meantime, while visual evidence of the evening slowly comes in, we remind you that **THE PPF ATTIC IS STILL AVAILABLE [HERE](http://ppfhouse.bandcamp.com)**.

If you don't got that **Attic**, you might as well be a Unicorn.

That's my word.

[**Musth** ](http://www.magnolius.com)and [(WPBE untitled)](http://wpbe.bandcamp.com) are headed to Mastering, [**Applause**](http://leo37.bandcamp.com) is headed to mixing, [**Howie's home**](http://www.ppfhouse.com/video) and[ **the Abyss**](http://www.myspace.com/thabyss) has plenty of treats headed your way.

It's hustle season folk. Get it.
