**We here.**

As some of you may know, I have travel A.D.D. To me, staying in one spot for too long is the equivalent of peeing the bed. It's warm and relaxing for the first little bit, but then it cools off and you realize you're covered in piss.

Okay....

....not the best analogy but the point is I like to move, and so do these dudes -

**[THE BLAST](http://theblast-blog.com):** a group of international artists/DJs/MCs/producers/writers/etc that have come together to bring you events worldwide as well as [one of the most eclectic blogs online](http://theblast-blog.com). Written in 3 different languages and with content as varied as their roster, there's a little something for everyone.

Having collectively shared stages with: The Roots, Aloe Blacc, Tittsworth, Del the Funky Homosapien, Mick Boogie, Kero One, DJ Ralph M (Funkdoobiest), DJ Fingaz (Xzibit), DJ Tommy (Edison Chen), DJ Clark Kent and Rob Swift just to name a few, as well as collaborations with: Adidas, Cartier, Dolce &amp; Gabana, Ed Hardy, Havianas, Heineken, Hennessy Artistry, Nike, Nokia, Remy Martin and Sean John, these party rocking vets guarantee nothing but the highest quality in all their product.

Formalities aside, they're dope. The product they release is dope. The parties they throw are dope. And the blog is super dope. So help us get the word out and let everyone know...[**It's the BLAST y'all!**](http://theblast-blog.com)

Pounds of love.
