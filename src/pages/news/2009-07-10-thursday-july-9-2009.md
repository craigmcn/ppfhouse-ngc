**APPLAUSE JULY 15th!**

That's right folks. July 15th is the date [**LEO37 + Sunclef**](http://leo37.bandcamp.com) *FINALLY* unveil the nonsense they've been talking about.

On top of the available digital download from their [**BANDCAMP**](http://leo37.bandcamp.com) site, they will also be bringing around limited edition **'Applause' Scarves** as well as the official **'Applause' Poster/Booklet/Drop Card** for a mere 20 quarters. These will be offered on a first come first serve basis to concertgoers, and will only be made available online following the tour. So get out before they get gone!

Finally, heed my words when I say:

**CHECK. BACK. MONDAY!**

You're not gonna wanna miss the little tiny present we dish out.

Be well world.
