**Happy New Year!**

I know we're a couple days late on this, but if you've been checking the calendar you'd know that worldwide we had functions bumpin and were destroying resolutions before they even had a chance to breathe.

Good on us.

**2009** was truly a divine year for **the House and we owe all of our supporters a huge thank you for allowing us in and helping us grow as a unit. We ended the year with tremendous momentum in [2 album releases](http://ppfhouse.bandcamp.com), a [\#1 charting on the CIUT Top 30](http://wpbe.bandcamp.com) and a nomination for [Best Rap/Hip-Hop album](http://magnolius.bandcamp.com) at the **Independent Music Awards**, and I'm happy to say, that for this first post of **2010**....it continues.

**WPBE @ THE REX**

Click the poster for details. Ghud times.
