**WE REACHED THE DL LIMIT IN 4 DAYS!!!**

Now I know this might be considered small beans to many, but y'know what? It feels nice to know that 2 months after our official announcement as a unit, things are choo-choo'ing along nicely and we're slowly but surely pulling into our next stop.

Keep it comin [PPFriends!](http://www.facebook.com/home.php#/pages/PPF-House/32210491219?ref=ts)

In the meantime here's the re-up! (Click Pic!)

[**MAG'**](http://www.myspace.com/magnolius)s still in Europe! I just got a message from Derek yesterday and it sounds like things are going smoothly for the boys. The life is being lived, the shows are being rocked and the Europeans are on the MAG train. He also promised some visual goodies soon enough so [*STAY TUNED!*](http://www.youtube.com/user/MAGNETIC4HEAD)

Also, the [**WPBE**](http://www.myspace.com/wpbe) are still at the [**Rex**](http://www.therex.ca) this Tuesday so be sure you make it out. Every week has gotten busier and heavier and we can only hope for the roll to continue. So let's vibe people.....

The next few weeks will have gems galore...promise.
