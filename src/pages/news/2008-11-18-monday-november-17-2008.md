Bleep Bloop Digi-cats!   
   
 A special short notice for you New York types:   
   
 This Thursday, Nov 20, [ASIFA-East](http://www.asifaeast.com/) (that's the East coast chapter of the international animation society) will be holding its biannual **Used Animation Art Auction** fundraiser at the **Tisch School of the Arts** (NYU).   
   
 Among the artists having work auctioned are Genndy Tartakovsky (Samurai Jack, Dexter's Lab), Lou Romano (from some company called Pixar), Bob Boyle (Wow, Wow Wubzy, Fairly Odd Parents), Robert Smigel (SNL), Mo Willems (Caldecott Winner) and... Howie (whah?) who has donated a very large painting from [Flutter](http://www.ppfhouse.com/flutter).   
   
 The event is being hosted by Mr. Tom Warburton (Codename: Kids Next Door) who, as best as we can tell, controls all of animation on the east coast.   
   
 So, if you're in NYC Thursday and feel like seeing some cartoons and/or buying some art, stop by. Art dealers are not allowed so prices will be awesome!
