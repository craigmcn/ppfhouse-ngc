**Twenty Two 2's.**

No, I ain't talkin bout Mr. Carter's first record *(although if you were out at **the Good Life** last night, you definitely would've had the privilege of hearing some extremely choice cuts from it -- shouts to the big homie* **[*Serpico*](http://djserpico.com/)*****!**),* what I'm talking about is **PPF**'s version of doublemint fun coming your way this Saturday for patrons across the globe.

First up, **the WPBE** in Hamilton.

Our very own Hammerville alum, **Chris Gale** and **Adrean Farrugia** return to their ol' stompin' grounds to kick up a dirtstorm of awful, awful, jazz interpretations of pop tunes. With promises of Justin Bieber covers and Celine Dion acapella arrangements, if you like car wrecks, then you won't want to miss this.

Meanwhile, on the other side of the world, **LEO37** will be playing his 2nd last Asia show date before he returns to the great white frostbite. Departure @ Sappho de Base in Taipei. Click below for details.

We'll see y'all on Saturday!

Be well world.
