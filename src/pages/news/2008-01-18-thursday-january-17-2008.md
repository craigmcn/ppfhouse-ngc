Greetings, Robots! 011011000!  
  
Happy 2008 from everyone at PPF House! This year, we are going to elbow smash evil in the face - and it begins... NOW!   
 **WPBE MINI TOUR W/ HAPPY APPLE**  
[**The Worst Pop Band Ever**](http://www.myspace.com/wpbe) is playing with [**Happy Apple**](http://www.myspace.com/happyapplejerks) (a side project of the **Bad Plus's** drummer, **Dave King**).   
22 Jan - Schuba's (Chicago, Illinois) with Jeff Parker  
24 Jan - Kerrytown Concert House (Ann Arbor, Michigan) with Angry Ape  
25 Jan - the Drake Hotel (Toronto, Ontario): 8PM  
  
The Band is also playing a special show TONIGHT (Jan 18) at the [**Hart House Arbor Room**](http://www.harthousemusic.com/viewseries.php?JAZ) (AKA **Jazz at Oscar's**) in Toronto. **Show starts at 9pm**.  
  
Also, continuing is the band's 7pm sunday residency at [**the Rex**](http://therex.ca/).  
  
So much WPBE you'll need to take it home for leftovers! But no need for microwaves 'cause that stuff is always hot! (zing!)

**FLUTTER MEETS PERSEPOLIS [Flutter](http://www.ppfhouse.com/flutter)** will be playing in front of **Golden Globe nominated film [PERSEPOLIS](http://www.sonypictures.com/classics/persepolis/)** in Montreal at the [Cinema du Parc ](http://www.cinemaduparc.com/) starting January 18 (tonight) for the duration of its run there. This is a great double bill for people who don't like colour!
