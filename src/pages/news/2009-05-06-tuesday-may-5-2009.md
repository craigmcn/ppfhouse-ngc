I have about 4 hours of stuff I need to get done in 2, so this update's gonna be short and sweet.

First off, [**Tanika Charles**](http://www.myspace.com/tanikacharles) is a beast.

Nevermind her long list of credentials, heavy touring past and [major accolades](http://www.nowtoronto.com/guides/readerspoll/2008/story.cfm?content=165744)...she deals with crappy soundmen and *still* manages to sound good.

Heavy.

The newest member of our extended Fam, **Tanika** will be headed to the stage this evening with our own [**Batman &amp; Robin**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jojOqtzKD8) (*I'm not saying who's who)*, [**MAGNOLIUS**](http://www.myspace.com/magnolius) who've just returned from their venture to the pre-University/post-Grad rite of passage known as Europe.

It kicks off at 9. **MAG'**s on at 9:30pm SHARP! So don't be late.

**The PPF Attic** is still up for grabs [**HERE.**](http://ppfhouse.bandcamp.com) Check it out.

Be well world. Everyone's home and feelings *will* be hurt.
