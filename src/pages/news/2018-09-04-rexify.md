It's been a great summer with Jazz Fest shows, our debut at the Old Mill, not to mention LEO37 getting signed to Sony, Adrean releasing a duo album with Joel Frahm, and Chris and Drew not self combusting. However, we're getting back into the grind next month with Saturdays at the Rex, 7-9pm. Octobers will never be the same.
