**Movement**

As finishing touches get put on ***Fanfare***’s second video, **FIRE DANCE,** I wanted to let y’all know there’ve been **11 new dates** added for December *(check calendar to the right)* which means things’re gonna get a touch nutty in the next few weeks and if you *can* be, you *need* to be.

In the meantime, I wanted to thank all the bloggers and fans who’ve continued to keep ***Fanfare*** circulating throughout the world wide blogosphere. If I could, I’d punch all of you dead in the face with love.

Hunh?

Yep.

Salutes for days.
