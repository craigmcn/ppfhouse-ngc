Yes, the April run has come to an end and it's been very dope. The crowds have been plentiful, the response positive, and the WPBE's Sax player, Chris Gale, has proven time and time again that he is, in fact.....the man *(a real Man, not like Amanda Bynes -- I'm not even gonna link that ish)*. Speaking of which, it's his Birthday tomorrow, so come out, shake his hand and watch the WPBE celebrate the evening with the raunchiest jazz you've ever dealt with.

.....and finally.....

**MAY 17th - THE PPF EXPO!**

Ladies and gents, the House is proud to present to you, on May Long, **Sunday, May 17th @ the Embassy** (Kensington Market) **- the PPF EXPO**!

To break it down simply....the PPF Expo is about good times. A mix of dance party with a dash of live love, the evening will feature all PPF members as well as some good friends over at [**5 and a Quarter Records!**](http://5and1quarter.com/)

More details and Flyer coming this week.

Be well world, I'll see you at the next show.
