Here goes:  
1\) According to a very nice review of the [**PPF House Basement Suite**](http://www.myspace.com/ppfwine) in this month's ***Exclaim! Magazine*** , "PPF has one of the most original sounds in Canada." We will also keep fighting and never give up. Ever. Read the full review [here](http://exclaim.ca/musicreviews/generalreview.aspx?csid2=865&fid1=27643&csid1=115).

2\) The **DESTRJOY! Tour** featuring [**Magnolius**](http://www.myspace.com/magnolius) and [**LEO37**](http://www.myspace.com/leo37) is burning through Asia this November. You think kimchi is hot? You're right. It is. But so are these guys. Dates are as follows:  
9 Nov 22:00 @ Club Cixi **Hong Kong**  
10 Nov 22:00 @ Play Den **Singapore**

3\) The [**Worst Pop Band Ever**](http://www.myspace.com/wpbe) is at the [REX](http://www.therex.ca/) **every Wednesday in October at 6:30**. The last show was so good that for a moment, an unhappy man traded bodies with a happy man and remembered , for the first time since his childhood, what a half full glass looks like. Meanwhile, the happy man got really depressed.

4\) From October 22-28 ***[Flutter](http://www.ppfhouse.com/flutter)*** and [***Ice Ages***](http://www.nfb.ca/iceages) will be playing at NFB theatres across Canada as part of the NFB's **World Animation Day** celebration, [**GET ANIMATED!**](http://www.nfb.ca/webextension/animation-day/). It's a great program of recent films, as well as workshops and master classes, and a nice opportunity to meet filmmakers and discover animation in all its forms. Howie will be on hand on October 26 at the 7 and 9pm screenings at the NFB Mediatheque in Toronto, so come on by if you feel the need to point and laugh.
