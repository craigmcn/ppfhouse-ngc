**PPF House on TV Around the World**  
HOWIE SHIA has recently directed and animated a PSA (aka. tv commercial) for the [**United Nations Habitat's *World Urban Forum III***](http://www.un-habitat.org) to be held in Vancouver this June. The piece was unveiled this week in **Cannes, France**, at the **MIP TV Festival** and will be hitting televisons around the world throughout the spring. By the summer, we here at PPF House expect to see world peace and equality for all. (woo-hoo! Slip'n Slides for everyone!)  
  
The piece was scored by none other than TIM SHIA of Worst Pop Band Ever fame (I hear they have an awesome album coming out this month) and performed by Tim and DREW BIRSTON. RYAN PATTERSON recorded and mixed the session and MICHAEL FUKUSHIMA produced it for the NFB.
