**PPF HOUSE FACES!** (I'm going with Faces, cause we don't deal exclusively with heads.)

It's been a long time coming but the site is revamped with the promise of oodles and oodles of goodies for the new year. Everyone is scheduled to drop *at least* **one** new record/project in '09 which means you'll be getting a ton of face time with the newly expanded crew....but I'll let them tell you bout it.

In terms of El TresSiete (for my latino supporters), I just finished the destruction of hundreds of calves with Washington sweetheart, URB magazine darling and B-More innovator, **Tittsworth** at **Plush** in Taipei. Experiencing one of the nicest guys you'll ever meet destroying a capacity crowd in that manner reminded me of that [poor Texas girls basketball team](http://www.worldstarhiphop.com/videos/video.php?v=wshh8zhrNQKv3u7WHv10)....Hell, just *being* there made me a candidate for the Evil league of Evil (*Bad Hoooorse*). Peace to the HHHT crew. We're heavy like that. Visual evidence coming soon.

As for upcoming material, I'll be headed into studio in March to begin work on the **LEO37 &amp; Sunclef** project with the first single **'Applause'** to be released late-April/early-May.

In the meantime, grab a drink, some snacky snacks and cruise around the site to see what's up.

Then, when you're done....head over to the HHHT blog for some free music, funny vids and more dopeness from ridiculoid DJ's.

Be well people.

You're in the House.

Triple.
