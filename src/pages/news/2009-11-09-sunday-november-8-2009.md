The [**MAGNOLIUS** ](http://magnolius.bandcamp.com)art contest is officially closed and the submissions are nutty!

Truly and sincerely, I just came from chillin with the **MAG** boys and they are having an *awful* time picking the top 12, let alone the top 2!

Thank you to everyone who took the effort and time to submit cause truthfully, some of these pieces are just mind blowing.

As promised, the winner will be announced by **MAGNOLIUS** in a weeks time, at which point we'll slowly begin to march out the top entries for your viewing pleasure.

Remember everyone, we have a *very* heavy week coming up so strap on your boots and let's get crackin.

We'll speak soon.

Be well world.
