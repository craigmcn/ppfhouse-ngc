A few more days until we Premiere at TIFF. Some photos of the [House](http://www.gettyimages.ca/detail/news-photo/musicians-leo-shia-tim-shia-and-director-howie-shia-from-news-photo/487718520) by GETTY images.

And here's the official [evite](http://www.eviteurl.com/bam/) with the details. There are a few tickets left for the Sept. 16th and 20th screenings but they're actually going fast.

Finally, here's a great [interview](http://blogs.indiewire.com/animationscoop/immersed-in-movies-howie-shia-talks-tiff-bound-bam-from-nfb-20150911) explaining the whole mess.
