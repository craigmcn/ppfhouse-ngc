Detroit, Detroit, Detroit.

I really can't say enough about this city and what it's meant to me as an artist. If it weren't for Detroit I would've never had **Motown**. I would've never had **Dilla**. I would've never heard **Slum Village**, **Eminem**, **the Fat Killahz**, **Guilty Simpson, Phat Kat, Black Milk,** hell we would've never had **TED NUGENT!**

And because of the way I blew Detroit up in my head all these years, this was obviously a really big show for me personally. Just to say that I rocked in the D would be enough. I wasn't even anticipating any kind of turn out or feedback, I just wanted this gig for resume's sake. Just another earned checkmark for my *Goals in Life* checklist.

Well, the trip started off exactly how I had anticipated. Abandoned buildings. Crumby neighbourhoods. Lots of Cops. The stuff that make up the scenery in many Detroit artists' content. But then, our unofficial tour guide *(Emily....you're the best)* started taking us on some detours and the city began to reveal itself.

Comparable to a less metropolitan **Shanghai**, Detroit had this incredible mixture of Gotham City'esque buildings intertwined with these grandiose abandoned buildings of the past creating this eerily gorgeous vibe. Something that the pictures I'd seen had never done any justice to.

After some cycling around and gawking, we headed over to the venue at around 10pm. An incredible little spot called **Old Miami** that was 100% character. From the Rifle and Guitar crest on the front of the building to the hardcore Americana decorations inside, to the giant backyard (not patio, BACK. YARD.) littered with patio furniture and statues of gargoyles, this place was dope.....but empty.

No problem. Like I said before, I was here for the experience and an experience was what I was getting. But low and behold, midnight rolls around and Old Miami gets ta bumpin.

The DJ starts killin the tunes. The atmosphere is aggressively friendly, and the people have now stepped away from their conversations, their bar stools and the pool table and have fully prepared for what proved to be a heavy ass show. Now, originally I had planned to break down all the performances, but this is getting a touch long winded, and I figure it'd probably work better if I sent you right to the artists' page.

Lemme just say this. This was the first bill I've been on in a LOOOOONG time where all the artists were of a *very* high calibre and Detroit proved once again that their batting average is ridiculous!

Anyway, **Sunclef, Tanika** and I ended up going 3rd before **MAG** and both acts received such a tremendous amount of energy and support from the first time audience that we couldn't help but be overwhelmed and completely humbled. Highs. Adrenaline. Smiles. It was just an incredible evening.

So....as the story goes, Detroit was ill, and we will undoubtedly be back as soon as they'll have us. Thanks so much to **Aaron** *(Blue Collar Gentlemen)*, **Rencen, Kodac, A.V. Club, Em, Matt** and everyone else who made the evening possible.

In the meantime, stay tuned for details on the release of the new **LEO37 &amp; Sunclef** on **July 15th!** *and maybe some special goodies before then.* Thanks for reading folk. We dissect **the Abyss** tomorrow and why he's well on his way to being the **Del** of the North. You heard me.

We gets it in.

Be easy folk.

Triple.
