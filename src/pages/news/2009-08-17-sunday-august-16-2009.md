[**PPFree's the way to go,**](http://magnolius.bandcamp.com)

**SLOW CLAPS IS OVER!**

Yes, as sad as that fact may be, it's also nice to get a little tiny break from life on the road (*and I do mean tiny cause we're back in 2 and a half weeks for the official release of **MARY MUSTH!** **SEPTEMBER 3rd!** - more on that tomorrow)*. And yeah sure, seeing Canada by van and interacting with amazing people on a nightly basis is great and refreshing, but damn....tour makes you fat!

That being said, this was the most successful and enjoyable tour any of us participating had experienced, and for that we say **THANK YOU.** Thank you to everyone who opened up their homes to us, to everyone who took the time to make our stay in their city extra enjoyable, to everyone who supported and bought merch, lent us equipment, brought their friends, to the sound guys, the promoters that actually promoted and to those who came to check us out even though you had to work in the morning. Thank you.

We have some super special footage coming your way documenting this amazing 3 week trek but also, we have some free ish too!

Click on the mysterious head above and reach on over to **MAG's Bandcamp** to get their brand new single **Tinman Sangue**. Just do it. I'd give you some big shpiel but I'd prefer it if you just took my word for it at this point. I'm not a douche, so just listen to me.

And if you haven't already, get **King For Hire** while you're at it.

Like I said before, stay tuned for some major announcements this week cause the ball well....is round....and thus......doesn't really stop rolling unless you put your foot in front of it, but then at that point you're just being a jerk.

Be well world.
