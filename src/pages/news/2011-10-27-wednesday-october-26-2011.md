**Thank you.**

As we near the end of this first week of release for **Fanfare**, I just wanted to drop in and say thank you to everyone who's made this such an incredible 5 days. The feedback, the support, the love, the damn near 1500 shares on Facebook in the FIRST day!? Thank you.

I know it might be premature for me to be getting so grandiose as we're still a long way from Kanye numbers, but I appreciate it nevertheless. Let's just keep building and I hope y'all will help me keep letting folks know exactly what's up!

Be well world.
