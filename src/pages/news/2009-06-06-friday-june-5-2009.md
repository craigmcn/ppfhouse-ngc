[PPFilm Fest Day 5,](http://ppfhouse.bandcamp.com)

Before I get started, let me just explain how proud of my team I am.  *If you were at Thursday's show, you'll know what I'm talkin bout.*

[**MAG** ](http://magnolius.bandcamp.com)weren't slated to be the openers, but they might as well've been. After the previous act had left the stage dead and the crowd dispersed, **MAG** had the daunting task of convincing the people that they were actually gonna have a good time Thursday. Well, with their Elephant like mannerisms and a clip full of **Musth** *(being mastered this week!!)*, **MAG** barrelled their way on stage and rocked **Sneaky Dee**'s to the ground. No T.V.'s. No costumes. Just fly songs and nasty stage etiquette. Needless to say, they made up for the anonymous bunch that rocked before'em and red bullied the evening.

As for **Mr. Headliner...**

...with a fistful of Mic, a headful of Free's *(Freestyles if you will)* and a disc full of beats by **Gigz**, [**Abyss**](http://www.myspace.com/thabyss) had the difficult task of following some incredible acts (shout outs to the homies **Apollo Creed**, **Sick Tricks** and **Guitar**) not to mention a battle against the clock, however with all that stacked against him, his freeform cadences and ridiculous hook writing kept everyone rockin till the last chune. Just let it be known, when he holds his pen..*\*pause\**...he ain't playin round with NOBODY!

So with that being said...let me just hit you with a quick 1-2.
