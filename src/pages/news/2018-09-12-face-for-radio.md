So after getting his feet with doing pop-up internet radio with Paul Chin's IStoletheSoul station, Tim was asked to put together a 4 part educational series for Jazz FM 91.1 in Toronto. Called "Jazz is What?" it airs Sundays in September, 8:30-9am. Radio will never be the same. Apologies to all real radio show hosts....
