***Flutter* wins Grand Prix at Tokyo International Anime Fair**  
Yup, **[Flutter](http://www.ppfhouse.com/flutter)** was awarded the **Open Entries Grand Prix** at the **[Tokyo International Anime Fair](http://www.tokyoanime.jp)**. Which was all very nice up until the part where Howie had to give an impromptu speech to a significant portion of the anime industry. That part not as nice.   
  
There's an English article about it at the **Leader Post** [**here**](http://www.canada.com/reginaleaderpost/news/arts_life/story.html?id=48d81cd5-fc45-400a-9a2a-2cc63deaf0a3&k=12459) and some more mention of it at the **Hollywood Reporter** [**here**](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/international/news/e3i10632efd792bb24ad8b99fab40b9e648), and a bunch of stuff in Japanese if you google the film.
