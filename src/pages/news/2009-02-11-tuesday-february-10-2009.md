Sure it's only the 11th, but the entire month of February seems to demand you rock with l'amour on a daily basis. Hell, **[Dilla](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ncSt5xC8Uk), [D'Angelo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqTXusdlOLk) &amp; [Robert Nesta Marley](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhTCiPd2Ue8&feature=related)** all hold their days of arrival in this, the [**Spud Webb**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5wBI98NXEE) of months.

So to comemorate it, [**Timmy Con Carne**](http://www.myspace.com/wpbe) (a.k.a. Mr. '[Thanks for Coming Out](http://www.ppfhouse.com/store/index.php?music&id=2)') has a big week ahead that begins with a rare appearance from the storied **'Love Orchestra'** and appropriately ends in Montreal with the lovely [**Rhonda Stakich**](http://www.myspace.com/rhondastakich). *(see calendar to your right)* --&gt;
