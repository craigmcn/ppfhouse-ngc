So after a busy summer, including a fun residency at the Rex in August, us folks here at the WPBE are gearing up for our big Western tour at the end of the month. We start in Salmon Arm on Sept.28, and end in lovely Saskatoon on Oct.9th, with 8 more stops in between including a recording and showcase in Portland and Seattle along the way. Plus lots of special guests to be announced later. Yeshhh!
