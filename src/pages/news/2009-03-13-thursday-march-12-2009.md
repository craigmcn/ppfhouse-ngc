The big [CMW](http://www.cmw.net) gig is tomorrow and truly promises to be an absolute circus of activity. Along with the [**WPBE**](http://www.myspace.com/wpbe), they've also enlisted the help of another Toronto super duo, DJ theatre extraordinaires, [iNSiDEaMiND. ](http://www.myspace.com/insideamind)Point being, this is gonna be brutally vicious like the attack of a [Tasmanian Tiger](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vqCCI1ZF7o).

Remember though, it starts **EARLY!**

[**6:30pm - 8:00pm @ Circa**](http://www.circatoronto.com)

Eat before or after because you won't want to miss the first, full-fledged unveiling of the massacre known as **Mary Musth**.

[...and if you've never seen MAG perform.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJ3KtAFf8Ks)

The entire [PPF Massive](http://www.facebook.com/home.php#/pages/PPF-House/32210491219?ref=ts) will be in the building, come say *'Whaddup'.*
