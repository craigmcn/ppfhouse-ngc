Once again, another situation of trying to fit a [Square peg in a round hole](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTGiLVj9r2g) *(can't believe someone put this on youtube -- I swear my birth is on there somewhere).*

I have 10 minutes to do 40 minutes of work.

Here we go.

[**MAG** ](http://www.myspace.com/magnolius)returned. Flight gear on. Scared people away. Made children cry. All in all.....[**very MAG**](http://www.youtube.com/ppfhouse).

[**Tanika** ](http://www.myspace.com/tanikacharles)beasted the supermarket! When I say beasted I mean like [Battle Beasts](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5O26Dtubh0) beasted. Damn.

And tonight....the [**WPBE**](http://www.myspace.com/wpbe) will be playing the live soundtrack to the incomporable [**Howie 'S. Pop' Shia**](http://www.ppfhouse.com/art)'s animations. Never done before and rarely done again. So come out and embrace the goodies of the [**PPF Grotto.**](http://www.myspace.com/ppfhouse)
