**TripleSeven Loyal**

To say *I'm speechless* again would just be redundant, so instead, let me say this: To those that have seen me perform countless times, yet, continue to come out, support, wild out and tell everyone they know all without demanding guestlist, thank you. You've put food on my table and clothes on my back and for that, I will forever be grateful.

To those who had their first **LEO37** experience last Saturday, I hope you understand that's just the tip of the iceberg. With 9 shows and counting in June, I hope to see you all out again soon.

For photographic evidence of the show, click the pic above for the gallery.

Be well world.

And thank you.
