**Red Bull.**

As you may or may not've noticed, the LEO37 event train has been pushing at full speed recently! With 4 shows under the belt in the past 6 days, there's been talk that the young man's stamina may be waning. However, I deny any and all allegations and offer you this: **[RE:DEFinition](http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=116622961757786).** The first chillout Hip-Hop/Soul/Reggae jam in Taipei in almost as long as I've been touring Asia. With no pressure to make you dance, just nod your head and chill with the homies, this is the ideal warm-up to the madness that generally ensues late in Taipei on a Wednesday and the perfect way to wrap an incredible month.

With July just around the bend, be on the lookout for a *LOT* more goin down.

**LEO37.com** coming soon!

Be well world.
