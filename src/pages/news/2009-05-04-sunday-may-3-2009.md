So the updates have been a little scarce as of late. Most of you know why so I won't even get into apologizing. But if you DON'T know, lemme break it down.

[**MAG'S HOME!** ](http://www.myspace.com/magnolius)

And are showing no signs of slowing. This [**Wednesday @ the Supermarket**](http://www.facebook.com/home.php#/event.php?eid=80456331391&ref=ts), **MAG** will be performing alongside Toronto Hip-Hop/House darlings **Art of Fresh**, as well as the massive voice of **PPF House** extended fam, [**Tanika Charles** ](http://www.myspace.com/tanikacharles)*(female is noyce!)*.

Oh, btw, if you don't know where **MAG's** coming home from, I suggest:

Or just hit up our [**YOUTUBE PAGE**](http://www.youtube.com/ppfhouse) for all PPF videos.

Along with that, this **Thursday,** [**the Worst Pop Band Ever**](http://www.myspace.com/wpbe) will be playing a *very* special performance at the **Lab Space** for their [**monthly HOT SOUP event.**](http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=52143970678&ref=mf#/event.php?eid=99654460341)

Why special? Well not only do you get to feast your eyes on the beauty that is the **WPBE** outer appearance, but they will be accompanied by a **GIANT SCREEN WITH HOWIE SHIA JOINTS!** (a la Spike Lee).
