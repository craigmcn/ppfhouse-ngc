Yes, it's been a minute and we've truly been negligent parents, but we're happy to announce, *We baaaaack!*

The past fortnight the crew has been inundated with behind the scenes type tasks in order to ensure you have a crazy Christmas and an even more absurd 2010.

First off**, Tim** and **LEO37**, though at opposite ends of the world have a crazy amount of shows and parties for the next two months for your listening enjoyment. I suggest you consult the calendar to your right for all the details.

Secondly, the [**PPF Store**](http://www.ppfhouse.com/store) is quickly running out of most **PPF Apparel** as well as many of the debut discs from our artists. Head over there now before it's too late to get your PPF stocking stuffers.

And lastly, you know how during the spring, TV has sweeps and the **Discovery Channel** usually has ***Shark week*** or something to that effect? Well, for the next 8 weeks, **PPF House** is proud to present to you our own **MAG** version of the sweeps, beginning with: **TUSK WEEK.**

Oh and one last thing, big shout out to **Cracker** for all the new changes to the site. You're the best webmaster ever.

Be well world.
