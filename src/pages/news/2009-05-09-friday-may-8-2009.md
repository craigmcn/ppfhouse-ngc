I'm feelin a touch *'****Homebody Status'*** today. The weather's doo-doo, the playoffs are on *(Triples' Picks: Pens, Canucks, Cavs and Nuggets)*, and dammit, [Old Snake still needs to kill Liquid Ocelot](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6V0JDyHoAU).

[**Sunclef and I**](http://leo37.bandcamp.com) just got out of studio yesterday with some heavy heavy features *(I love watching dope people do dope things)* and things are looking good. We'll officially be dropping <span style="font-weight: bold;">'Applause' </span>**early July** and really are busting at the seams to get this out to the people. Stay tuned in upcoming weeks for some *'interesting'* footage.

Speaking of which *(awesome segue Leo....awesome)*....click below to head to our **YouTube page.** Tons of [**MAG**](http://www.myspace.com/magnolius) goodies as well as lots of new material from Abyss and the rest of the crew as well.

...and keepin on the topic of [dope visuals](http://www.ppfhouse.com/video/) we ([**the WPBE**](http://wpbe.bandcamp.com)) just finished playing at one of the most entertaining nights I've been a part of in a long time. John Candy tribute songs, Godzilla by Mouth and soup? Damn homie. Thanks to [Hot Soup/Labspace](http://www.labspacestudio.com) for hooking that up, we'll definitely be returning.

In the meantime, summer tour plans continue to be set as dates will begin popping up on the calendar in a matter of weeks. So stay glued doggie doggersons. We're headed coast to coast and even a little south....pause.
