Hello Giants!  
  
It's been a long time since our last update. It's because we've been busy. So busy that this is also going to be a short notice, but rest assured, many projects are in the works including stuff for TV, theatre, continuous Asian touring and prep for new albums and exercise videos (we're doing it straight old school: leotards, leg warmers, head bands and VHS. We were going to go all the way to beta, but it turns out nobody cares about picture quality.)  
  
Anywhoooo: How many of you have wondered to yourselves, late at night, by the fire, holding a loved one in your arms: "I wonder how much testosterone you can fit into a two octave keyboard?" Well ask no more, because tomorrow night (that's **Tuesday, April 29, 2008**) the **MICRONAUTS** return to the **[Tranzac Club](http://www.tranzac.org/)** in Toronto, performing man-sized hits from the 80s on toddler-sized instruments from where ever the guys could find them. The band features: **Ali Berkok** on (micro)keys, **Mark Laver** on (un petit)saxophone, **Mike Smith** on (fake)bass, and **Tim** on drums he bought for his 3 year old daughter. Here are the detes:  
  
WHAT: The Micronauts Birthday Bash for Drummers  
DATE: Tuesday, April 29, 2008  
WHERE: The Tranzac Club (292 Brunswick Avenue, Toronto)  
TIME: 7PM  
  
Be there because the world is more awesome if you believe in the power of tiny plastic things.
