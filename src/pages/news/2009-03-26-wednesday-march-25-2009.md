Dear Good Parents of the world,

I recently had the privilege of sporting your sneakers for 3 days and I must say, I've never been privy to that kind of exhaustion *ever* in my life....and that was just 3 days.

Like, I've driven cross Canada with only power nap intervals and a double double to keep me goin. I've done 13 flights between 7 countries in 3 weeks where the only reliable source of rest we had was the upward sitting postion of economy class Airplanes. Hell, I've done the 9-5 grind where after work, I still had to come home and work on my *actual* work and still, nothing compares to the exhaustion of being a good parent.

By good parent I mean you converse with your children, teach them, spend time with them, make sure they're eating right and exercising enough, make sure you're stimulating their minds and teaching them between right and wrong while still preserving their wonderment of the world. By good parent I mean you give a fuck from rude awakening right on down to temper tantrum bathtime.

If you qualify as a good parent.......I salute you.

**Thanks 媽 &amp; 爸**
