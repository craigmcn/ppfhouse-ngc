[**PPFantastic,** ](http://ppfhouse.bandcamp.com)

What can I say aside from **WOW!** &amp; **THANK YOU!**

The [**Mary Musth**](http://magnolius.bandcamp.com) Album release was truly a tremendous success and we'd like to thank everyone for providing us with so much love and respect. Your constant support is the only reason we're able to continue doing this and trust us....we're very much aware of it. So Thank you.

Now, at this point, I'd normally give you a verbal rundown of how the show went, but we were lucky enough to have **Aaron Miller** of **CityTV's** '*The Untold City'* on hand to provide those who weren't able to make it with a Photo Essay of how the night went. Click below and get to vibin'.

Enjoy this Saturday folk. It's a special one.
