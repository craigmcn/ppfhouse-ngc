2 SLEEPS TIL THE EM-EFFIN' [**EXPO!**](http://www.facebook.com/home.php#/event.php?eid=95326836426&ref=ts)

Get your invite requests in NOW! Go to the **EXPO** link above and tell us why you wanna be there! It's gonna be small, sweaty and live as hell!

Other than that, I really don't have anything else to report. THIS'LL BE NUTTY LIKE A PORNSTARS FURNITURE!

[**Applause**, ](http://leo37.bandcamp.com)**[Mary Musth](http://www.myspace.com/magnolius)** and the [*'yet to be titled'* ](http://wpbe.bandcamp.com)**[WPBE](http://wpbe.bandcamp.com)** album are all being mixed right now and should all be getting sent away for mastering within a matter of weeks. I've heard all 3 projects, and well, I'm not gonna lie, they sound.......

Also, a big announcement coming up in roughly 2 weeks time. Be prepared for a wild summer people.

But until then.....get your visors on cause the **EXPO**'s in 2.

Be well world.
