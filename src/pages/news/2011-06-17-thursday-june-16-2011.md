We'll be opening for the great *Uri Caine Trio* from NYC. **June 29**, at the *Rex* (of course), 5-7pm. We'll be playing with special guest, **Eric St. Laurent**, who will also be playing with us as part of *Now Magazine's SoundClash* Competition at the *Harbourfront* on July 15th (more info to come). We promise we will not incite any car burnings.
