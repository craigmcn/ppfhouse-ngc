In lieu of our cancelled gig tonight at the Rex and in honour of our boy, Adrean becoming a Master of something or other, we are presenting a series of short music videos we did, unrehearsed and socially distant. The first is one of his tunes, REMember, filmed and recorded by the Mighty Matt Dusk, with camera help by Terrific Tania Shia and Editing by Loose lips LEO37.
