***Don't call it a comeback.***

After what seems like an eternity, I've finally arrived back here with all of you.

Hi.

My natural instinct during times like this is to just rant, rave and spew but why spoil this moment with a bunch of '*neither here/nor there*'s.

[Watch the video](http://youtu.be/aCJD1cDvqjg). [Download the song](http://leo37.bandcamp.com/track/fanfare). And lemme know whassup.

Good to see y'all again.

I'll be checkin in very soon.

Be well world.
