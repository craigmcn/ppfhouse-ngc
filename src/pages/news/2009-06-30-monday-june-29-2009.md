First off, the show in St. Catharines was wicked! Huge thanks to [**Vangel**](http://www.myspace.com/vangelmusic), **Marinko** and **Danimal** for their hospitality, hard work and especially their excellent culinary skills.

Damn, I coulda performed to *no one* as long as I got those meals. You know homie's on point when he starts showing Chinese people new ways to prepare tofu. Ill tactics.

But yo...aside from that it was a great debut for the[ **LEO37, Sunclef** ](http://www.myspace.com/leo37)and **[Tanika Charles](http://www.myspace.com/tanikacharles)** circus that's about to hit the road in a matter of weeks - *new details coming very very soon* - and that accompanied by the trapeze equivalent known as [**MAGNOLIUS**](http://magnolius.bandcamp.com) will only prove to be absolute mayhem.

Anyway, St. Kitts, we *will* be back and in tremendous form. But in the meantime...

**MAG @ PHOG LOUNGE** *(Windsor)* **THURSDAY**!

Featuring the entire crew back together again for their first full studio album as well as features from long time collaborators, **Rob Richie, Rhonda Stakich** and **Elizabeth Shepherd.** Beware people, it's bout to get heavy.
