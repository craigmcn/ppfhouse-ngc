Perhaps because we were called "a highlight" of last year's TD Canada Trust Jazz Festival on the official tojazz website, local impresario, Brownman, kindly, but foolishly, invited us back as part of his curated series.

Little did he know the great review was actually a result of the free absinthe and backyard mushroom samples being handed out that night.

 <pso>June 22, Adrean Farrugia, Chris Gale, Drew Birston and I will be at the *May Cafe*, 876 Dundas St. West, from 9pm -12am.We are hoping Mayor Ford will introduce us but have a feeling he has other things to do on a Saturday night.
