**Woof!**  
To commemorate the new lunar year, we've added a new strip to the [Century of Love](century.php), a couple of new drawings to the [art gallery](art.php), and updated the mysterious *Tamardi* link.  
  
Happy Year of the Dog!

*Summer* in Spring**  
The music beds for [LEO37](leo37)'s new album, *Summer*, were recently recorded in Toronto. The record features some of Canada's top session musicians playing all new tunes by Threeseven, Bok Sau, and Sizzly Poppa. Look for it in the spring!
