***"Where've you been?"***

Been gettin that email a touch too much lately so I figured it was about time I jumped back on the interweb and show my face.

Whaddup world?! Hope y'all have been well. Spent the last month in studio with the big homie **John Poon** plugging away at the new record *(Due out Sept 20th, 2011! Look out for top secret leaks and visuals come spring!)* and getting things prepped for my return to the motherland...

...and now that I'm back in Asia for the next little while, I've got plenty of goodness lined up for my TW massive, so stay attached to the calendar on a daily as events are coming in hourly.

In the meantime, a new word exchange with **Taiwan's #1 site for Whus Happ'nin.**  Shouts to the homie M.A!

I'm back. Let's get it.

Be well world.
