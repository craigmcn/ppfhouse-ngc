**SUMMER is Here, Complete With New Website!**  
**LEO37**'s new CD, ***SUMMER***, is in our office and [ready to ship](javascript:store_2())! A drastic departure from *WINTER* (37's debut), this new album features an all-live band made up of **[Tim Shia](http://www.ppfhouse.com/timshia), [Dafydd Hughes](http://www.sideshowmedia.ca), Chris Banks &amp; Christine Bougie**; with guest appearances on vocals by **[Al Buddy Black, Liquid Serebral](http://www.spitsociety.com), Abyss, Rhonda Stakich,** and **[Nick Zubeck](http://www.nickzubeck.com)**; production credits go to **[LEO37](leo37), [Bok Sau](timshia), [Sizzly Poppa](howieshia), Sunclef**, and that **Zubeck** kid again.  
  
To promote the album, we've put together a [**new website**](leo37) (once again constructed by the mighty [Big Cracker](http://www.bigcracker.ca)) which includes **audio clips** from the new record and **tour information** on the soon to begin **GIANT STEPS tour** featuring **LEO37 &amp; BamBoomBox**.  
  
So, go check out the [**website**](leo37), then go to the [**store**](javascript:store_2()) to order the CD, then go whoop it up with the kids on one of their tour dates -- because it's never too early for summer.  
  
That was a very cheesy thing to say.
