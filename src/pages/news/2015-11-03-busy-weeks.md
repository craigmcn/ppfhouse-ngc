We got a busy next couple of weeks as BAM and another movie Tim did some music for, Go For Broke, by Aram Collier are screened at the [REEL ASIAN Festival](http://www.reelasian.com/). Meanwhile, the WPBE is performing with the Western University Jazz Ensemble, under the leadership of Kevin Watson, at Wolf Hall on Nov.10 in London at 7:30.
