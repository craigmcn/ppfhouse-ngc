Rings.

August 21st, 2010.

The entire **PPF House** would like to take this opportunity to salute and congratulate **The Abyss** and his lovely wife **Desiree** *(a.k.a. Mrs. Abyss a.k.a. one of PPF's regular photogs)* for their amazing exchange of nuptials this past weekend.

The love was immense. The party was bangin. And Abyss told ZERO animal jokes. Awesome.

To the newlyweds, nothing but love and happiness from here to there and forever more.

Put it in your chest.

Be well world.
