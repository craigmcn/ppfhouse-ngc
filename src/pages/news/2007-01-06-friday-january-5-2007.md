**PPF 2007 Calendar**  
Now available from the [PPF Store](javascript:store_2()) is the new **PPF 2007 Calendar** featuring a selection of Howie's artwork from the past year (and a bit).  
  
The piece is a double-sided off-set print on coated M-Real Venetian, measuring 21.5" x 10" - and all for only ten bucks! Woo-hoo!  
  
There's only a limited number available so [order now](javascript:store_2()).

**Worst Pop Band Ever Podcast** In case you missed the live [WPBE](http://www.myspace.com/wpbe) performance on [CIUT](http://www.ciut.fm) last week, it's now available as a podcast from the official [It's (A)live website](http://www.frankcasting.com). And, heck, while you're at it, check out the performance by our good friend, [Brian MacMillan](http://www.myspace.com/brianmacmillan) which is available there as well.
