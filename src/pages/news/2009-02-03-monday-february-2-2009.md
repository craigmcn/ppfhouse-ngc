PPF Houseans,

I know it's only been a few days since the re-launch, however I can't help but feel a little giddy at the prospect of '09.

New albums from [WPBE](http://www.myspace.com/wpbe), [MAGNOLIUS](http://www.myspace.com/magnolius), LEO37 &amp; [Sunclef](http://www.myspace.com/sunclef) and[ the Abyss](http://www.myspace.com/thabyss), not to mention a slew of video projects courtesy [Howie](http://www.myspace.com/howieshia) and crew and etc. Heck, I might even start selling *PPF House Brand Dumplings* out the trunk of my car. Y'never know.

In the meantime, new flicks, info and special downloads over at [**LEO37's** ](http://www.ppfhouse.com/music/leo37/)house of cards.

Not to mention a couple dope shows this week as well as a slew of others next week from LEO37 and the WPBE.

It's gettin hectic!

Just the way we like it.
