It's [MAG](http://www.myspace.com/magnolius) month!

With shows coming up on the **6th**, **9th**, **14th** and **27th** *(see calendar on your right for details)* you know that **Mary Musth** is nearing completion and Shan and Derek are just about ready to feast on your unborn at full strength. Deeeeelish.

Anyway, while we divise a line-up of treats for you to indulge your MAG tooth on, here's an appetizer.
