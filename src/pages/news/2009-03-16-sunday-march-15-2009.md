As promised, [**MAG**](http://www.myspace.com/magnolius), [**Tim &amp; Co.**](http://www.myspace.com/wpbe) brought their A-game, but this isn't news. *(Not being arrogant, but if we aren't firing at all cylinders every show, how can we expect you to come support?! ....and support you did!!!)*

Thank you to everyone who came out and continue to come out so we not only have an audience to rock to, but the necessary feedback that ensures our improvement as both performers and artists. Please keep it up and we'll do everything we can to hold up our end of the bargain.

Meanwhile, this Saturday, **[The Abyss](http://www.myspace.com/thabyss)** will be in Barrie as he previews tracks from his upcoming opus with **Gigz** *(that has a super secret title that if spoken,would turn you into the worm in a bottle of tequila, only to be drank by our good friend **Jose Alejandro Lopez Hernandez**.* Real name, no gimmicks.)

All the while, [**Tim**](http://www.ppfhouse.com/music/timshia) will be on tour with **Emma Cook** in the States for the next week culminating in a **SXSW showcase**. Check calendar for deets --&gt;
