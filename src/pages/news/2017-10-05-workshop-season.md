So we're super happy to be part of Jazz FM and JPEC's (respectively) jazz workshop series for the next few months. Corrupting young minds with the sounds of the Worst Pop Band Ever is a favourite past time. We're also pleased to announce that we're presenting a master class at Carleton University on Nov.3, along with a trio of shows in Ottawa that weekend. We're at the Brookstreet Hotel the evening of the 3rd and 4th and doing an in store at the super hip Record Centre at 2pm on the 4th. I'm hoping Justin will pick up our food bill...
