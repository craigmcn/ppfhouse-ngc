Busy is good. This is what we believe.

With April kicked off *(and thankfully I didn't get rocked by any April Fool's pranks this year -- not like that one year where they announced that there would be a backpackers version of 'Def Jam Vendetta' starring Mos Def, Kweli, Common and that lot. Man....I wanted it to be true so bad!)* we have plenty killin right now.

First up, as you know, **MAG** are in Europe. With already, what I'm told was a DOPE show in Amsterdam, their next stop will be headlining one of Berlin's largest Urban Music Festivals, **Hip Hop Don't Stop**. I'm not sure Europe has prepared for **Shan**'s expressive eyebrows and **Derek**'s Blue Steel looks. Click below for more info.

...they will be hosting the [Classic Rex Jam](http://www.jazzintoronto.com/) every **Tuesday** this month starting at **9:30pm**. If the above picture is *any* indication of the way they'll be playing...be prepared to rock the eff out.

And finally, on **April 7th**, **[PPF House](http://www.myspace.com/ppfhouse)** will be presenting the **PPF ATTIC -** A compilation of b-sides and basement goodies from every member of the House *(not to mention, a brand new bonus cut from* [**Sunclef** ](http://www.myspace.com/sunclef)*feat.* [**The Abyss**](http://www.myspace.com/thabyss) *&amp;* [**LEO37**](http://www.myspace.com/leo37)*all FREE FOR DOWNLOAD.*)

Stay tuned for it. Cover art coming your way.

It's Friday folk, get live.
