With two successful warm up shows under our belt (thanks to [**Em** ](http://vegetarianselectronics.blogspot.com/)and [**Aaron**](http://unitedstatesofmind.bandcamp.com)), **CLIPPED WINGS** is about to kick into high gear with 20 shows in 32 days and we're beyond excited to get it cracking.

Be well world.

Let's get it.
