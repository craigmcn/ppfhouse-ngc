**The Century of Love on Free Comic Book Day**  
In celebration of **[Free Comic Book Day](http://www.freecomicbookday.com/)** (**Saturday May 5** all across North America - it's a real thing), a brand new **[Century of Love](http://www.ppfhouse.com/century.php)** strip will be appearing in "[***Comics Festival***](http://www.torontocomics.com/tcaf/)" a very impressive comics anthology published by the folks at the **[Toronto Comic Arts Fair](http://www.myspace.com/tcaf)** (which is looking like it's going to be awesome this year). The book features some serious comic book heavy weights including **Darwyn Cooke** (***DC New Frontier/Batman: the animated series***), **Bryan Lee O'Malley** (***Scott Pilgrim***), **Chip Zdarsky** (***Prison Funnies***) and is edited by comic book writer/journalist/colourist/sage foreman, [Christopher Butcher](http://comics212.net/).  
  
Howie will be at [the Beguiling ](http://www.beguiling.com) (in Toronto on Markham St. just off Bloor) on **Saturday** at **3pm** signing copies of **Comics Festival** and drawing pictures (if you want him to). Come out and say "hi" lest the event turn into a scene out of Spinal Tap. Remember the comics are free. No joke. Tonnes of them. Free.

*PPF House: the only thing better than free is you.*
