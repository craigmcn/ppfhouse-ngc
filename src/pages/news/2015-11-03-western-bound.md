Looking forward to joining forces with the Western University Jazz Ensemble, under the leadership of Kevin Watson, at [Wolf Hall](http://www.londonpubliclibrary.ca/about-my-library/library-spaces/wolf-performance-hall) in London next Tuesday, Nov.10, 7:30pm. Kevin has prepared a sumptuous program including Radiohead and the Yellowjackets...what?
