[Greetings and salutations PPFians,](http://www.twitter.com/ppfhouse)

As you know, it's the month of [**MAG**](http://www.myspace.com/magnolius), and like anything MAG does, this month promises to get pretty offensive.

I just got back from watching them rehearse with [Tim Shia and co.](http://www.myspace.com/wpbe) and lemme tell you, you're not ready. Truthfully. You're not.

Like obviously everyone in the history of self-promotion is obligated to say that they're '*Amazing!*' or that they have some *'Hit Single'* but you know as well as I do that those statements tend to culminate in the form of....well...[this.](http://mishkanyc.com/bloglin/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/powhitetrash.jpg) And because of these circumstances, anyone who might *actually* hold merit (*a.k.a. the innocent)* are left in to rot with the rest of the compost heap *(a.k.a. the other inmates).*

Well, the innocent have arrived and are coming to a city near you.

It's just sooo serious.
