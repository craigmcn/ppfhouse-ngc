5\) **HOWIE'S BEEN BUSY**: Howie's been busy. In point form:

\- just finished a new short film entitled '*Peggy Baker Four Phrases*" commissioned by the NFB and the Governor General's Performing Arts Awards Foundation. Produced by Michael Fukushima, with music by Tim Shia and animation by Howie and the mighty [Lillian Chan](http://www.lilch.ca), the film is a brief animated documentary about Canadian dance legend Peggy Baker - a founding member of Toronto's *Dancemakers* dance company, and former dancer with *Lar Lubovitch*â€™s celebrated New York company as well as *Mikhail Baryshnikov's* and *Mark Morris*'s *White Oak Dance Project*. Since 1992, Ms. Baker has been the artist-in-residence at the National Ballet School of Canada in Toronto where her current dance company, [Peggy Baker Dance Projects](http://www.peggybakerdance.com), is also based.

\- just finished a music video with Pasquale LaMontagna for Mush recording artist (and co-composer for Nickolodean's *Avatar: the Last Air Bender)* , [DERU](http://www.deru.la). Stay tuned for a release date. There's a big robot in it.

\- Howie is hard at work on a top secret TV project (NOT *Chinatown Cops* - which is also still simmering). We can't say too much yet, but rest assured it is going to be the greatest action/adventure/comedy kids show that Howie has ever created. (although, being his only action/adventure/comedy kids show, one supposes that it's also guaranteed to be his worst. Art is deep. Like the ocean. Like a well.)

\- finishing a bumper for the [Toronto Summerworks Theatre Festival](http://www.summerworks.ca) and also contributed background visuals for **Kitchen Band Productions** "*Petrichor*" (written and directed by the elbow smashing Erin Brandenburg) as part of the Toronto Harbourfront Centre's Hatch project for new theatre (that was actually in April, but it was awesome)

6\) **PPF BREAKS OUT:** Howie did the animation and online game design for CBC's new tween doc series "[BREAKOUT!](http://http://www.breakoutonline.ca/)" Tim did the music! Check it out Saturday mornings on CBC.
