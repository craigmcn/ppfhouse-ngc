After an incredibly dope weekend on both sides of the pond *(big love to Taipei and Hamilton respectively)*, the **PPF** fam are preparing to bring everything back home for February before their big Canadian Voyage in March.

**LEO37** has one last show this Saturday as he returns to his ol' stompin' grounds, **Seven**, for their [**Moving Out**](http://www.facebook.com/#!/event.php?eid=148551681867502) party. Having been given free reign to do as he please, this will undoubtedly end up in violence and heartache. Perfect.

As for the **WPBE**, they will be returning to **the Rex** every Wednesday in February. So be sure to stop in, grab a drink, some grub and listen to the worst pop you've ever heard in your life. Ever.

Stay tuned to the calendar as new show dates are being added daily.

Be well world.
