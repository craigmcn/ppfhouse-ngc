Well ladies &amp; gents,   
   
 IT'S DONE!   
   
 Clipped Wings has finally wrapped and I'm caught somewhere in between a mute and a ramble.  
   
 The amount of adjectives that I have stored up about this tour is damn near the size of one of those Oxford mini-travel dictionaries and as such, I'll do my best to refrain from breaking it down too much.  
   
 With that said, after 5 years of touring, this was easily the most successful, the most difficult and the most memorable of all the ones I've been on and for that I felt it justified to write this note.  
   
 From starting in a gloomy night in Windsor to wrapping it up with an opportunity to spin at an Aloe Blacc show, through 100+ hours of driving, moose, deer, raccoons, blown tires, plastic wrapped windows, short circuited windows, something that resembled tonsillitis and plenty more, I've arrived at this point alive and content.

To everyone who came out, bought a ticket, bought merch, told a friend, shook a hand, booked work off and destroyed a pair of shoes, **THANK YOU**. You are the only reason we're able to this and I thank you for allowing us to pursue our dreams. To everyone who housed us, fed us, lent us their showers, made us some coffee and just generally gave us aid, thank you for keeping us alive. Road life is difficult and the breaks you've provided has made this all the more tolerable. To [**USM**](http://www.usmdet.com), I have no words to describe the experience. Thank you.

And before I end this mini-essay, I'd like to hype you on what has been our anthem for this tour and also the promo video for my personal Hip-Hop album of the year. I hope you'll all take the time to download and absorb.
