You have to excuse me if I gush a bit, but gawtdamn if this guy isn't a beast. From his freeform cadences to his ruthless hook writing to his playful and genuine demeanor, there're few who can do that roots, boom bap, H-I-P, H-O-P ish like this guy without sounding corny or overly nostalgic. Case and point, the Drake performance *(the Venue not the Degrassi kid)* that occurred the other night.

Sandwiched between subpar rap acts and less-than-inspiring funk revitalists, **The Abyss** was able to pull the crowd out of their *too cool for school* lull and DDT'em straight on their head like Jake Roberts of old. Performing songs from his upcoming album with Toronto super producer, **Gigz** *(Due out in October!)* as well as classics off '07's [**PPF House: Basement Suite**](http://ppfhouse.bandcamp.com/album/ppf-house-basement-suite), Abyss just keeps getting better and better and better. So, the moral is, if you don't get on this train now, well, you're gonna have to walk to school.

What?

Yep.

Alright Fam, tomorrow's the big **Applause** announcement.

Stay tuned. In the meantime, go listen to some [**PPF HOUSE!**](http://ppfhouse.bandcamp.com)
