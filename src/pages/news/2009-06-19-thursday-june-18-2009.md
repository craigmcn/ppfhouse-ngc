[PPFridayers,](http://ppfhouse.bandcamp.com)

This has been one of the best weeks in [**PPF**](http://ppfhouse.bandcamp.com) history.

**MAGNOLIUS** dropped their brand new single **'KING FOR HIRE'** from the upcoming **'MARY MUSTH'** album Monday and it's been flying off the bandwidth!!!

**It's Free.**  It's Awesome. It has ridiculous art accompanying it (only the tip of the iceberg my friend). And you need to go get it [**HERE**!](http://magnolius.bandcamp.com)

On top of that we've announced the dates for this summer's **PPF** blockbuster **SLOW CLAPS TOUR! And well...now we have visual aid courtesy the monstrosity known as [**Howie Shia**](http://www.ppfhouse.com/art), *a.k.a. H.Shhhhhhhhhhh.*

On top of all this, we have a couple warm-up gigs coming up that you definitely won't want to miss.

First up we have [**LEO37 &amp; Sunclef**](http://leo37.bandcamp.com) with **PPF** alum [**Tanika Charles**](http://www.myspace.com/tanikacharles) in **St. Kitts** next Saturday with our good friends [**Vangel**](http://www.5and1quarter.com) and [**Apollo Creed**](http://www.myspace.com/takabasapollocreed). This is gonna be ruckusful. And apparently **LEO37**'s hosting it as well?? Should be interesting.

Meanwhile **MAGNOLIUS** will be in Windsor, rockin one of our favorite venues (and apparently Canada's *favorite* venue as voted by the CBC), **Phog Lounge** the following weekend with a few guys from the D! This shall be fine indeed.

Okay, that's enough excitement for one post.

As for next time, big [**WPBE**](http://wpbe.bandcamp.com) announcement in a *MATTER OF DAYS*, as well as new [**LEO37 &amp; SUNCLEF**](http://leo37.bandcamp.com) material in a *MATTER OF WEEKS!*

Everyone's on their grizzly and ain't no stoppin us now.
