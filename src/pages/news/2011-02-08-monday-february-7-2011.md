After a whirlwind run of Taiwan culminating last Sunday at the annual **Freakout! Beast** music festival, I am now officially back in the great white frostbite and itching to get back it with the boys.

First up, every Wednesday this month *(as previously advertised below)* then *March Madness*, but we'll get to that soon enough.

In the meantime, arguably my favorite song of 2010 finally gets visual treatment. Shouts to A. Biggs, Draztik, Sleepy Biggs, Joey P. and the whole **USM** contingent. Nothin but love fellas.

We'll see y'all tomorrow.

*"I'm never stoppin what I give, I'm feelin it inside, if I'm a leader then let me lead, don't hold me down."* - W. Draztik

Be well world.
