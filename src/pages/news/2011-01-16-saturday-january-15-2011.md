**I GO FOR MINE.**

After a ruckus filled weekend full of things opposite of sausage, we bring you another event of the same nature.

This Wednesday, **LEO37** will be posted up alongside Chicago's own turntable bully, **DJ Serpico** to bring you another installment of [**The Good Life**](http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=133275913401241&set=a.101583226570510.2191.100001564985557#!/event.php?eid=156422777741827).

No cover. Cheap drinks. The best music. That's a **PPF** promise.

And stay tuned Thursday as we give you a little more to chew on this weekend including a **LEO37** farewell and the **WPBE**'s return to Hamilton. But until then....Wednesday. See y'all there.

Be well world.
