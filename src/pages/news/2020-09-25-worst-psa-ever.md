At the beginning of the summer I asked some friends to help with a one minute educational video about active listening.

Now seemed as good a time as any to release it with tensions still on the rise across the globe (sadly, for a multitude of reasons). Here then is our effort to contribute even just a tiny bit of relief.

Many thanks to all the musicians who participated, and if you liked what you hear please think about contributing to their various music projects through Bandcamp, Itunes, Paypal. You can find more about each in the description of the video. Click here for the [worst PSA Ever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BFimwjCiaM "worst PSA Ever")
