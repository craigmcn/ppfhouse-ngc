Dearest friends

Welcome to the year of the Ox: work hard, play hard, core hard.

We here at PPF House are heavy with agenda this year, starting off with the February 1st launch of our brand new website which will feature new videos, new art, and our new expanded music roster. Following that, keep an eye out for new releases from *the Worst Pop Band Ever*, *LEO37*, *MAGNOLIUS, Sunclef* and *the Abyss*, as well as a little something called *Chinatown Cops* that will be airing on Teletoon in the early summer.

Happy New Year, folks. *This time, it's real.*
