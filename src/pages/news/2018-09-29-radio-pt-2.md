So radio madness continues as Tim's series on Jazz FM 91.1 has been extended for another 4 episodes (8:30-9am every Sunday), and he's also taking part in the Istolethesoul FM pop up radio event at Nuit Blanche with the "Worst Jazz Program Ever" this weekend. Come join him at the Scarborough Town Centre at 5AM on Sept.30....yes 5AM.
