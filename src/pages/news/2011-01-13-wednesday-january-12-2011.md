**Can't Stop, Won't Stop.**

PPFam,

Y'all are obscene! Almost near capacity by 9:30pm on a Wednesday night?! Absolutely unreal. Needless to say, **UnderU** was a huge success and we are forever grateful for the love and support. A big thank you once again goes out to [**Go Chic**](http://gochic.bandcamp.com) for putting us on and letting us rock such a wonderful event. Nothing but love and safe travels as you head out on your WORLD TOUR!

As for upcoming shenanigans, this Saturday, Jan. 15, for those who like things that are the opposite of sausage, the CD release for **Sam Clayton and Brilliant Corners** at **the Annex Live** (8pm) and wouldn't you know it, Tim's in the band.

Also this weekend, [**the WPBE**](http://wpbe.bandcamp.com) returns with special guest **Rhonda Stakich** at **the Emmet Ray** on Sunday, 9pm. We'll be playing songs that make you cry...so we can mock you.

Finally, some photographic evidence from [**LEO37**](http://www.facebook.com/leothreeseven)'s **PSA** event last weekend. Click the pic below for the album.

Be well world.
