***Flutter* is here!**  
We are very pleased to announce that PPF's official website for Howie's new animated short,[ **Flutter**](http://www.ppfhouse.com/flutter), is now live. The site offers clips of the film as well as artwork, creator bios and DVD ordering information.   
  
Howie will be accompanying the film to its world premiere at the [**Tokyo International Anime Fair**](http://www.tokyoanime.jp/en/) taking place **March 22-25**, so if you happen to be around Tokyo at that time, come on out to the event and say "hi."  
  
The film features music produced by [**Sizzly Poppa**](http://www.myspace.com/sizzlypoppa) and performed by the **PPF House Band** (aka, **[The Worst Pop Band Ever](http://www.myspace.com/wpbe)**).   
  
**Flutter** is produced by Michael Fukushima for the [**National Film Board of Canada**](http://www.nfb.ca/flutter), and co-produced by Howie for **PPF House**.
